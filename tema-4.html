        <h2>Transitioning to Proactive Defense</h2>
        
        <p>As the world becomes more connected (through 5G, IoT, and Cloud), the attack surface for cyber threats grows exponentially. **Cybersecurity** is transitioning from being a preventative measure to a fundamental business strategy, focusing on resilience and rapid recovery.</p>

        <p>The future of security is defined by **proactive measures** and automation:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>**AI-Powered Defense:** Using Machine Learning to analyze network traffic and instantly detect anomalies that human analysts might miss.</li>
            <li>**Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA):** A security model that insists on strict identity verification for every user and device trying to access network resources, **regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter.**</li>
            <li>**Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):** Developing new encryption methods to protect data against the theoretical threat posed by future quantum computers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>**Key Challenge:** The talent gap in cybersecurity remains massive. The reliance on sophisticated AI tools and automated responses will become essential to managing the constant barrage of threats.</p>
