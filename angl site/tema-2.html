        <h2>Decoding AI: More Than Just Robots</h2>
        
        <p>**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the ability of a computer system to simulate human intelligence to perform tasks such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation. At its heart lies **Machine Learning (ML)**, which is a subfield of AI that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.</p>
        
        <p>Essentially, ML systems use vast amounts of data to **train algorithms** to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions. The rapid advancements we see today are driven primarily by **Deep Learning (DL)**, which uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to analyze complex data like images, sound, and text.</p>

        <h3>Key ML Paradigms:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Supervised Learning:** Training with labeled data to predict outcomes (e.g., classifying emails as spam or not spam).</li>
            <li>**Unsupervised Learning:** Discovering hidden patterns and structures in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).</li>
            <li>**Generative AI:** The newest frontier, focusing on creating new content, such as text (GPT models), images (Midjourney), and even code.</li>
        </ul>
