        <h2>IT's Role in Environmental Responsibility</h2>
        
        <p>As technology proliferates, so does its environmental footprint. **Sustainable IT (Green Tech)** is a growing discipline focused on designing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of computing resources with minimal environmental impact. The IT industry is committed to becoming a solution to, rather than a cause of, climate change.</p>

        <h3>Key Focus Areas:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>**Energy Efficiency:** Optimizing Data Centers to reduce power consumption (e.g., using renewable energy, implementing advanced cooling techniques).</li>
            <li>**Circular Economy:** Promoting the longevity of hardware, responsible recycling (e-waste reduction), and refurbishment.</li>
            <li>**Green Software Engineering:** Writing code and building applications that require less computational power and energy to execute.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This transition involves utilizing AI to optimize energy grids and logistics, making IT the crucial enabler for a globally sustainable future. **Ethical and Environmental responsibility** is rapidly becoming a core pillar of modern technological development.</p>
